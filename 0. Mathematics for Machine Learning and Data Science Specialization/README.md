# Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization

    * Calculus
    * Linear Algebra
    * Statistics
    * Probability


- Represent data as vectors and matrices and identify their properties like singularity, rank, and linear independence 
- Apply common vector and matrix algebra operations like the dot product, inverse, and determinants 
- Express matrix operations as linear transformations 
- Apply concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to machine learning problems including Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Optimize different types of functions commonly used in machine learning 
- Perform gradient descent in neural networks with different activation and cost functions 
- Identity the features of commonly used probability distributions 
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to find, validate, and quantify patterns in a dataset 
- Quantify the uncertainty of predictions made by machine learning models using confidence intervals, margin of error, p-values, and hypothesis testing. 
- Apply common statistical methods like MLE and MAP
